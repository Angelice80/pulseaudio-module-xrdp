Pulse audio notes.

to see what version of PA is on your machine
pulseaudio --version



To build xrdp pulse sink,
get the pulse source that most closely matches your version on
your machine.  Get the source from 
http://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/releases/
run ./configure after extracting.  I don't think you need to build it.
edit Makefile to point to your pulse source directory.



PA always respawning

  To stop its respawning habit, open /etc/pulse/client.conf, change
  autospawn = yes to autospawn = no, and set daemon-binary to /bin/true.
  Make sure these lines are uncommented, like this:

autospawn = no
daemon-binary = /bin/true
